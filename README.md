# public-value-metrics.github.io

The website for **[Public Value Metrics](https://github.com/public-value-metrics/public-value-metrics)** — a comprehensive introduction to public value math, examples, and reasoning, written for software engineers building for governmental and social sector organizations worldwide.

Published at <https://public-value-metrics.github.io/>.

## How it works

A [SvelteKit](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit) site built with [adapter-static](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/adapter-static). Every page is prerendered to plain HTML at build time, so GitHub Pages serves files and nothing else — no server, no database, no tracking.

The book's Markdown is **vendored** into `content/` rather than read across repositories, so a fresh clone builds on its own. The site's user interface is built from the [Lily Design System](https://github.com/LilyDesignSystem): the headless components and the theme/locale/text-size/share pickers are ordinary npm dependencies (`@lilydesignsystem/svelte-headless`, `@lilydesignsystem/svelte-picker-bar`), imported from `node_modules` like any other package. Only the theme stylesheets are vendored, into `static/assets/themes/`, because Lily does not publish those as an npm package.

### The book's README is the table of contents

`content/README.md` defines the structure, and the site derives everything else from it:

- each `## Heading` becomes a **part** of the book
- each `- [Title](locales/en-gb-oxendict/topics/slug/) — blurb` under it becomes a **topic**, in reading order
- that order drives the sidebar, the contents page, and previous/next

Reorder the README upstream, run `pnpm run sync`, and the site follows. A topic file that the README never links to is still published, under an "Also in this book" part, so nothing becomes unreachable.

## Develop

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm run dev
```

## Build

```sh
pnpm run build     # -> build/
pnpm run preview
```

## Sync from upstream

```sh
pnpm run sync           # both of the below
pnpm run sync:content   # book Markdown -> content/
pnpm run sync:lily      # Lily themes  -> static/assets/themes
```

Both scripts default to sibling checkouts and can be pointed elsewhere:

```sh
BOOK=/path/to/public-value-metrics pnpm run sync:content
LILY=/path/to/lily-design-system pnpm run sync:lily
```

Vendored files carry a "do not edit here" banner. Change them upstream, then re-sync. The Lily components themselves are not vendored — bump `@lilydesignsystem/svelte-headless` and `@lilydesignsystem/svelte-picker-bar` in `package.json` instead.

## Layout

```
bin/sync-content.mjs   vendor the book's Markdown into content/
bin/vendor-lily.mjs    vendor Lily's theme stylesheets (components are npm deps)
content/               the book, verbatim (generated — do not edit)
src/lib/markdown.js    Markdown -> HTML: link rewriting, heading ids
src/lib/paths.js       content path <-> site route mapping
src/lib/server/        content access and book structure (server-only)
src/routes/            home, contents, topics A-Z, topic pages, search, about
static/assets/style.css  the site's own styling; Lily ships none
static/assets/themes/  vendored Lily themes, swapped by the theme picker
```

The Lily headless components (`ArticleLayout`, `Header`, `Card`, ...) come from `@lilydesignsystem/svelte-headless`; the header's theme/locale/text-size/share row comes from `@lilydesignsystem/svelte-picker-bar`. Both are regular npm dependencies — see `package.json`.

Content lives under `$lib/server`, so the book's Markdown can never reach a browser bundle: pages read it from `+page.server.js` loads, which run at build time under prerendering.

## Locales

This book publishes in 16 locales — the canonical English (Oxford spelling), three further English variants, Welsh, and full translations into Chinese, Hindi, Arabic, Spanish, French, Russian, Bengali, Portuguese, Indonesian, and Urdu. The site never hardcodes this list: `content.js`'s `locales()` discovers it from whatever `content/locales/*/` directories `sync-content.mjs` vendored, so a new locale in the book publishes here with no code change. Labels and ordering live in `src/lib/locales.js`.

Every locale keeps the book's English slugs for its topic directories (only the content is translated, never the directory name), so cross-locale links never need special-casing beyond the ordinary `-ize`/`-ise` English spelling split (`benefits-realization` vs `benefits-realisation`).

## Themes

All Lily default themes ship in `static/assets/themes/` — not a curated subset. `PickerBar` offers them in its own default order, so the site never hand-maintains a theme list. The site's stylesheet is written against Lily's semantic tokens (`--lily-surface`, `--lily-text`, `--lily-space-*`), so every theme works without a per-theme branch. Theme and text size choices persist in the reader's browser.

`pnpm run sync:lily` re-vendors every theme stylesheet found in the Lily checkout's `themes/` directory — there is no per-site curation to edit.

## Deploy

`.github/workflows/pages.yml` builds and deploys on every push to `main`. In the repository settings, set **Pages → Source** to **GitHub Actions**.

The configuration follows the SvelteKit guidance for [GitHub Pages](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/adapter-static#GitHub-Pages):

- **`fallback: '404.html'`** — every route is prerendered, so the fallback is only reached by a URL that does not exist. GitHub Pages serves `404.html` for those, which replaces its default 404 page with this site's own (`src/routes/+error.svelte`).
- **`static/.nojekyll`** — stops Jekyll from stripping paths that begin with an underscore, such as `_app/`.
- **`paths.base`** — this repository is named `<org>.github.io`, so the site is served from the domain root and the base path is **empty**. The docs set `BASE_PATH` to the repository name; that is correct for a *project* site served from `/<repo>/`, and wrong here — it would serve the site from `/public-value-metrics.github.io/`. The workflow therefore leaves `BASE_PATH` unset.

To deploy this source somewhere that *is* under a subpath, set it at build time:

```sh
BASE_PATH=/some-subpath pnpm run build
```

Links in the built output are relative (SvelteKit's `paths.relative` default), so the site also survives being moved without a rebuild.
